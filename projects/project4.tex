\section{Objectives}

\myparagraph{In this assignment you will add interactive elements to your previous designs. Again, take care to use good software engineering practices. }

\section{Ground Rules}

\section{Assignment Instructions}

\begin{itemize}

\item Download the data set at \url{
http://www.calvin.edu/~stob/data/srsatact.csv}. This dataset contains standardized scores for all Calvin College 2004 seniors that have taken both the ACT and the SAT, together with their GPAs. There are 271 data points and 4 dimensions.

\item Modify your sketches from Project 2 and 3 to have a 800x600 resolution. 

\item To your BAR CHART, LINE CHART, and SCATTERPLOT, add an interaction that pops up data information when the mouse is over/clicks a particular bar/data point. Add to all of your plots the ability switch which attributes are being visualized.

\includegraphics[height=2.5cm]{../images/linechart.png} 
\hspace{15pt}
\fbox{\includegraphics[height=2.5cm]{../images/scatterplot.png}}
\end{center}

\item To your SCATTERPLOT MATRIX, add a detail view (an additional large scatterplot). Add an interaction such that when a plot is selected in the scatterplot matrix, it updates the detail view to those data attributes.

\includegraphics[width=4cm]{../images/splom+detail.png} 
\end{center}

\item In addition, download (at least) TWO (2) of the other datasets provided on Canvas, and make sure they work with your sketches.

\item Add any additional interactions that you think will make your sketches more useful.

\item Modify your sketches such that they use additional visual channels to encode additional variables. Consider using color, size, shape, depth, etc. Your selection and their implementation will have an impact on your grade.

\item Add embellishments of your choice. These can include but are not limited to: axis lines, labels, and tick marks. Consider the margins for your embellishments (try to pick good values for the tick marks and a good number of them---not too many and not too few). Your selection and their implementation will have an impact on your grade.

\item Make your visualizations robust by designing them to support any data (number of elements or value range) and by designing them to support any size or aspect ratio of canvas.
