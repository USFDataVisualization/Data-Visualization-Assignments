\section{Objectives}

\myparagraph{In this assignment you will learn the basics of Processing, and create a few Processing sketches that implement basic visualizations. These will be building blocks for future assignments, so take care to use good software engineering practices. You will create 3 sketches.}

\section{Ground Rules}

\section{Assignment Instructions}

\begin{itemize}

\item Download and familiarize yourself with Processing (\url{http://processing.org/download/}). Use the available tutorials (\url{http://processing.org/tutorials/}) and examples (\url{http://processing.org/examples/}) to help you understand how Processing works.

\item Create a data file. Your data file should be a csv format file (\url{http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001356.htm}). The file should contain the following headers \{YEAR, VALUE0, VALUE1, PARTY\} and values $\Big[$\{1992, 7.30, 88, DEM\}, \{1996, 5.60, 43, DEM\}, \{2000, 4.00, 76, REP\}, \{2004, 5.70, 90, REP\}, \{2008, 5.00, 12, DEM\}, \{2012, 8.30, 14, DEM\}, \{2016, 4.90, 50, REP\}$\Big]$.

\item Create a sketch with 600x600 resolution that opens a file dialog box (\url{http://processing.org/reference/selectInput_.html}) and loads a selected csv data file. You can start with the skeleton code provided on Canvas.

\item With the given data file, draw a BAR CHART for the data (you get to pick which variables to use).

\end{center}

\item Create a 2nd sketch (same resolution and dialog box), and draw a LINE CHART for the data (again you get to pick which variables to use).

\end{center}

\item Create a 3rd sketch (same resolution and dialog box), and draw a LINE CHART on top of a BAR CHART with the data.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4cm]{../images/bar_and_line_chart.png}
\end{center}


\item Modify your sketches such that they use additional visual channels to encode additional variables. Consider using color, size, shape, depth, etc. Your selection and their implementation will have an impact on your grade.

\item Add embellishments of your choice. These can include but are not limited to: axis lines, labels, and tick marks. Consider the margins for your embellishments (try to pick good values for the tick marks and a good number of them---not too many and not too few). Your selection and their implementation will have an impact on your grade.

\item Make your visualizations robust by designing them to support any data (number of elements or value range) and by designing them to support any size or aspect ratio of canvas.

\end{itemize}


\section{Submission}



\myparagraph{We will be using a git repository for submissions throughout the semester. A script will automatically scrape your solution at the deadline. \textbf{Please follow these instructions carefully, particularly in the naming of your repository and the project directory.} If done incorrectly, we won't get your submission, and you'll get a 0.}

\myparagraph{If you've never used git before or just aren't that comfortable with it, try a video tutorial, such as \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9r4}.}


\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Create Account:} Visit Bitbucket and setup your account  --- \url{https://bitbucket.org}. Please use your \textit{@mail.usf.edu} for your free academic account.

\item \textbf{Setup Repository:} From your dashboard, create a new repository ($+$ sign on the left, then repository).
 Name the repository ``datavis\_$<$your NetID$>$''.

\item \textbf{Set Permissions:}  From your repository go to Settings$\rightarrow$User and Group Access. \\
Add \textit{ghulamjilani@mail.usf.edu} and \textit{prosen@usf.edu} with Read access to your repository.

\item \textbf{Install git} on your local machine. 
\begin{itemize}
\item For Windows, I recommend TortoiseGit (\url{https://tortoisegit.org/}). 
\item For Mac, install xcode (\url{https://developer.apple.com/xcode/}) and then the command-line tools (\url{http://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html}). 
\item For Linux, git should already be installed. If not, use the appropriate package manager (e.g.\ apt or yum) to install it.
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Clone the repository} locally (i.e.\ \textit{git clone $<$url to repository$>$}).

\item \textbf{Create the project directory:} Create a directory named \textbf{project1} and place all of your files in it. If you name it anything else, our script will fail (and so will you).

\item \textbf{Submission:} As you work on the files, and when you're done, make sure you add the files to the repository (i.e.\ \textit{git add}), commit the changes (i.e.\ \textit{git commit}), and push changes to the remote server (i.e.\ \textit{git push}). If you fail to do this, we won't get your files. 

\item \textbf{Verify:} You can verify that your files have been properly uploaded by checking the Source page on the bitbucket website.

\end{itemize}
