\section{Objectives}

\myparagraph{In this assignment you will build a well-studied information visualization interfaces, Parallel Coordinates Plot (\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_coordinates}). Again, take care to use good software engineering practices. }


\section{Ground Rules}

\groundrules



\section{Assignment Instructions}

\begin{itemize}


\item Create a sketch with 800x400 resolution that opens a file dialog box (\url{http://processing.org/reference/selectInput_.html}) and loads a selected data file. 

\item Create a sketch with a PARALLEL COORDINATES PLOT that shows all variables.

\item Add in an axis swapping interaction.

\item Add any additional interactions that you think will make your sketches more useful, such as data point tracing (highlight a data point when mouse over) or axis direction switching (swapping +/-). Your selection and their implementation may have an impact on your grade.

\item Make sure your code works with the Calvin College dataset and at least 1 other dataset from Canvas.


\item Modify your sketches such that they use additional visual channels to encoding additional variables. Consider using color, size, shape, depth, etc. Your selection and their implementation will have an impact on your grade.

\item Add embellishments of your choice. These can include but are not limited to: axis lines, labels, and tick marks. Your selection and their implementation will have an impact on your grade.

\item Make sure your visualizations are robust by designing them to support other data (number of elements or value range) and by designing them to support any size of canvas.
