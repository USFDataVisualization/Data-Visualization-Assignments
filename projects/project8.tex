\section{Objectives}

\myparagraph{In this assignment you look to address scalability concerns with your previous sketches by using aggregation techniques. Again, take care to use good software engineering practices. }

\section{Ground Rules}

\section{Assignment Instructions}

\begin{itemize}

\item Download the skeleton code and data provided in Canvas$\rightarrow$Files. This dataset contains character coappearence in Victor Hugo's Les Mis√©rables, compiled by Donald Knuth. Node in the graph are characters. Edge in the graph signify characters appearing in the same chapter of the novel.

\item Fill in the portion of the code for loading the data, noting that it is in JSON format. JSON is a more flexible storage format than CSV, but it is also more complicated to parse and load. Please see Processing reference on parsing JSON Objects\footnote{\url{https://processing.org/reference/parseJSONObject_.html}} and JSON Arrays\footnote{\url{https://processing.org/reference/parseJSONArray_.html}}.

\item Using the data, fill in the code sections for creating a force-directed graph layout\footnote{See section 12.2 of \url{https://cs.brown.edu/~rt/gdhandbook/chapters/force-directed.pdf} and the extra powerpoint slides provided on canvas}. You will only need to calculate forces, draw the graph, and code interactions.

\item (50\% extra credit) Create a distance matrix for the points using Shortest Path Distance\footnote{\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm}}. Now draw the graph by projecting the points using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)\footnote{You can use the MDSJ library for this, \url{http://algo.uni-konstanz.de/software/mdsj/}}.

\item Add any additional linking or interactions that you think will make your dashboard more useful. Your selection and their implementation will have an impact on your grade.

\item Modify your sketches such that they use additional visual channels to encoding additional variables. Consider using color, size, shape, depth, etc. Your selection and their implementation will have an impact on your grade.

\item Add embellishments of your choice. These can include but are not limited to: axis lines, labels, and tick marks. Your selection and their implementation will have an impact on your grade.

\item Make sure your visualizations are robust by designing them to support other data (number of elements or value range) and by designing them to support any size of canvas.
